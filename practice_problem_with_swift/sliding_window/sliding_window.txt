Sliding Window Algorithm :
The sliding window is a data structure technique 
that transforms two nested loops into a single loop within an array or list.

Sliding Window problems are problems in which a fixed or variable-size window is 
moved through a data structure, typically an array or string, to solve problems 
efficiently based on continuous subsets of elements. 

This technique is used when we need to find subarrays or substrings according 
to a given set of conditions. [Geeksforgeeks].
